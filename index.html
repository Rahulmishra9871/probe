            The Probe&#39;s &quot;Truth Brigade&quot; is all about bringing
            unseen stories into the light—stories that too often go unheard in
            the rush of mainstream media. We dive deep into issues that touch
            the very heart of our society: from the struggles within our
            healthcare system, to the challenges posed by climate change, the
            stark realities of poverty, child labour, and the ongoing fight for
            education, women&#39;s rights, gender rights, and social justice.
            Our work doesn&#39;t just highlight problems; it sparks real change,
            improving lives and strengthening communities.<span class="readmore"

                <p>But telling these stories isn&#39;t easy. It takes time, effort, and a lot of
                    legwork. We travel to the heart of the issue, talk to those directly
                    affected, and piece together the truth from the ground up. This
                    kind of journalism—dedicated, thorough, and
                    uncompromising—requires resources.</p>

            BPL Realities: The Invisible Lives on the Margins

          <div class="card-content">
            <p>&quot;BPL Realities: The Invisible Lives on the Margins&quot; is an
            initiative by The Probe aimed at shining a spotlight on the hidden
            lives and the day-to-day realities of people living below the
            poverty level in India. Despite no official updates on India’s
            poverty estimates since 2011, it is known that the spectrum of
            poverty could range significantly, affecting between 2.5% to 29.5%
            of the population based on various estimates between 2014 and 2022.</p>
            <p>Beyond mere storytelling, we are committed to uncovering the raw,
            unfiltered experiences of BPL families across India—narrating not
            just their struggles for basic necessities like food, clean water,
            healthcare, and education, but also their resilience and undying
            hope amidst adversity. This vast segment of the population, often
            neglected by mainstream media, has stories that demand to be heard
            and understood.</p>
            <p> In addition to bringing these narratives to the
            forefront, our effort extends to exploring and presenting potential
            solutions that could significantly improve the lives of BPL
            families. Our reporting aims not only to highlight the issues but
            also to probe and suggest actionable strategies that can lead to
            sustainable impact.</p>

            <p>In the face of global environmental challenges, the narrative around
            climate change often feels overwhelming, with focus scattered across
            various issues like rising temperatures, declining biodiversity, and
            extreme weather events. &quot;EcoGuardians: Now or Never is an
            initiative by The Probe, designed to unify these concerns under a
            single, relatable banner. This project aims to go beyond the
            conventional discourse, focusing on the interconnectedness of air,
            water, flora, fauna, and the human communities that depend on them.</p>
            <p>Our effort is to illuminate the intricate web of life that sustains
            our planet, showcasing not only the fragility of our natural world
            in the face of climate change but also the resilience and
            adaptability that exist within it. &quot;EcoGuardians&quot; seeks to
            engage and educate the public on the comprehensive impact of climate
            change, while also highlighting innovative and practical solutions
            to build resilience and minimise environmental impact.</p>
            <p> The challenge
            of climate change is immense, requiring not just awareness but
            action that spans local, regional, and global levels.
            &quot;EcoGuardians&quot; will focus on how communities worldwide are
            retrofitting solutions to combat the effects of climate change, from
            restoring natural habitats that act as carbon sinks to implementing
            sustainable urban planning that reduces environmental footprints.</p>

          <div class="card-content">
            <p>Healthcare disparities are continuing to widen across India.
            Lifeline: Equal Health Access for All is a Truth Brigade project
            dedicated to uncovering the stark inequalities in healthcare access
            and quality experienced by vulnerable populations, specially those
            living in close proximity to environmental hazards such as landfills
            and drains, and those residing in remote areas, far removed from
            functioning Public Healthcare Centres.</p>
            <p> By bringing these
            underreported stories to light, &quot;Lifeline&quot; aims to
            catalyse a national conversation on health equity and drive
            substantive policy changes that ensure equal healthcare access for
            all. &quot;Lifeline&quot; is committed to investigating the systemic
            barriers that prevent equitable healthcare delivery to all segments
            of society, with a particular focus on vulnerable groups. The
            initiative will engage directly with affected communities, giving
            them a platform to voice their struggles and aspirations for a
            healthier future.</p>
            <p> By exposing the realities on the ground and
            leveraging the findings to push for policy reforms, the project
            seeks to bridge the gap between marginalised communities and quality
            healthcare services. The anticipated outcomes include increased
            public awareness of health inequities, mobilisation of support for
            infrastructural improvements in underserved areas, and the
            implementation of more inclusive health policies.</p>
